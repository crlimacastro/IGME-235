        <p>In the mysterious lands of the <span class="name">Grand Grassland</span> food has become quite scarce.
            Different races of animals have found their way of life disturbed and need to
            create new societies in order to survive the harsh environment. One of the most
            successful societies to come out of this situation is the nomadic tribe of <span class="name">Hamster
                Warriors</span>. Led by the incredible intuition of a wise sage who understands the
            alchemic properties of the elements, this tribe of hamsters have found success in
            dividing its numbers into three different groups.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> <span class="name">Gatherers</span>, who do exactly as their name suggests, find food and water at
                every
                stop in the tribe's journey.</li>
            <li><span class="name">Alchemists</span>, who collect various natural materials such as dirt,
                leaves, sticks, etc... to assist the grand sage so that he may spend more time
                thinking about how to invent new creations or optimizing old ones.</li>
            <li>Lastly there are the <span class="name">Bouncers</span>, the tribe's scouts and powerful defense line.
                They are called that
                way
                because they have been equipped by the sage with special hamster balls made of rubber
                that store elastic energy built up by bouncing around between surfaces. The Bouncers
                train each other in the art of using this incredible weapon to defeat foes much larger
                in size. Snakes, eagles, foxes, many have fallen short to the expertise of the Bouncers
                before. The biggest hero of the tribe, warrior <span class="name">Rico Chet</span>, is the most
                dexterous and
                courageous fighter of them all. The game will center around the legend of how Rico
                escorted his tribe across the Grand Grassland and into greener pastures so that they may
                return to their burrow settlement lifestyle.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="aesthetics">Aesthetics</h3>

        <p>The game will have a cartoony art style. The story is an epic tale sprinkled with the
            fantasy and humor that comes with a tribe of nomad hamsters fighting epic wars against
            predators ten times their size.</p>

        <p>The music will be fast paced to match the action displayed on screen.</p>

        <p>The UI will be minimalistic. Most information displayed to the player, such as momentum
            charge, will be expressed through color change and intensity as well as through sound.
            The game will have a lot of screen shake and impact sounds to sell the action of hamsters
            in rubber balls bouncing around between walls to land one gigantic hit on their foes.</p>

        <h4 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h4>

        <h5>Player Interaction</h5>
        <p>The player will face off enemies in different arenas filled with surfaces all around them (rocks, trees,
            logs,
            etc...). These surfaces will be used to crash the hamster ball into them. Before completely crashing into
            the
            surface or wall, the player can hold the <span class="gameplayButton">Momentum Charge</span> button in order
            to pause the game for a few
            seconds
            and
            shoot off in the direction that they are pointing in once they release. These bounces are the way to build
            up
            speed
            and momentum in order to deal more damage to enemies. When the player is satisfied with the amount of
            momentum
            they
            have built up or cannot control the speed they are going in anymore, they can point towards the enemy and
            charge
            at
            them with all the speed they have built up. Damage will be dealt based on the momentum the player has
            accumulated.
            It is important to note that the faster the player goes, the harder it will be to control. Faster reaction
            speeds
            will be needed to pick the direction on time without losing the charge.</p>


        <h5>Surfaces & Obstacles</h5>
        <dl class="imgDL">
            <div class="imgDefinition">
                <dt>Rocks:<img src="media/rock.png" alt=""></dt>
                <dd>These surfaces will have different shapes and sizes and will be scattered about in an arena so that
                    the
                    player can bounce off of them. Rocks will allow for a lot of intricate shapes to make walls out of.
                    There
                    can be L-shaped rock formations, triangles, etc... </dd>
            </div>
            <div class="imgDefinition">
                <dt>Logs:<img src="media/log.png" alt=""></dt>
                <dd>These will be rectangular surfaces that the player can bounce off of. They will be simpler walls and
                    more
                    common than rocks. </dd>
            </div>
            <div class="imgDefinition">
                <dt>Trees:<img src="media/tree.png" alt=""></dt>
                <dd>Circular surfaces for the player to bounce off of. The trees will be represented by a cut down
                    stump,
                    this
                    is just a representation of the tree drawn at a lower y-plane. In reality they will be whole trees
                    and
                    shadows will be drawn below them to communicate this.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="imgDefinition">
                <dt>Bushes:<img src="media/bush.png" alt=""></dt>
                <dd>Bouncing on these surfaces will result in the player losing all momentum as they are soft and
                    cushioned.
                    The
                    player will have to avoid bushes in order to keep a momentum combo going.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="imgDefinition">
                <dt>Water:<img src="media/water.png" alt=""></dt>
                <dd>The player will be able to charge through water puddles on the ground if they have enough speed
                    built
                    up.
                    Running up to a puddle without enough momentum will result in the player moving at an incredibly
                    slow
                    rate
                    and floating around. The player will be susceptible to an enemy attack when coming out of a puddle.
                </dd>
            </div>
        </dl>

        <h5>Enemy types</h5>
        <p>The player will face off different enemies. Small ones like weasels and feral cats will be fast but have less
            health
            and will require lower minimum momentum to actually damage them. Bigger enemies such as foxes, jackals, and
            snakes
            will have tougher skin and require the player to build up a certain amount of momentum to even be able to
            damage
            them. Bouncing towards them will less than the required speed will cause the player to just bounce off of
            them
            harmlessly and fall as easy prey to a claw swipe attack or a bite. Snakes will be especially tough as they
            will
            require the player to hit them in the head to damage them, making them a very tough skinned and small
            target.
        </p>

        <p class="stretchGoalDisclaimer">
            Birds of prey planned as a stretch goal:
        </p>


        <p>Eagles and owls planned as possible predators for the player to face off. They will require the
            implementation of
            a
            z-axis and a way for the player to bounce off into the air. They will be even harder to hit than small
            weasels
            and
            cats and will be more aggressive than them. However, they will be very fragile and thus have very low
            health.
        </p>

        <h5>Health and Enemy Attacks</h5>
        <p>The player will have a health bar attached to the condition of the rubber hamster ball. Having enough damage
            dealt
            to the ball will break it and Rico will fall easy prey to the animals he is facing. Dying will result in a
            <span class="gameCondition">Game Over</span> and requires the player to start the level over again. Enemies
            can deal damage to Rico in several
            different
            ways. For example:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Swiping their claws in front of them.</li>
            <li>Performing a lunge attack.</li>
            <li>Biting in front of them.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The player will have to make sure to keep moving constantly to avoid these attacks. When the player is hit,
            they
            will be thrown with some momentum in the opposite direction.
        </p>

            <dd>When heading towards a wall, hold to build up momentum for the next bounce.
                Game will slow down to sell the effect of speed and to give the player a few seconds to think of where

                are
                going to bounce towards (Holding down the mouse button for too long will cause all elastic energy to be
                lost. Time
                frame is reduced the more energy is built up, making it harder to keep a big combo of bounces for higher
                damage).

        <h5>Note</h5>
        <p>The big difference between Mouse and Controller is that for Controller, if the player does not point in any
            direction the elastic energy will be lost and the hamster will not bounce off, whereas with the mouse the
            hamster
            will always blast off in the direction of the pointer unless canceled.
        </p>

        <h4 id="learningCurve">Teaching Game Mechanics</h4>
        <p>At the beginning of the game, the player will be taken to a flashback into Rico's past. They will have to
            pass
            the
            Warrior Training Regiment he had to go through in order to join the great Hamster Warrior tribe's famous
            Bouncers.
            It will be a tutorial level where a veteran drill sergeant hamster will explain the game mechanics to the
            player.
        </p>

        <h4>Learning and Mastery</h4>
        <p>
            The difficulty curve of the game will be found in the unconventional and hard-to-master combat system.
            Attacking
            is
            attached to the movement of the player, so they will have to get comfortable building up high speeds to deal
            massive
            damage to their foes. Different spikes in the curve will also be encountered when the player meets a new
            enemy
            type
            and they have to learn their movement and attack patterns, as well as the specific way to defeat that enemy
            type.
