                We decided to use the Amiibo API for our project two design.
                The user can search any character in the search bar and the API will return information on that Amiibo.
                The random button will display a random Amiibo,
                the show all button will display all Amiibos in a gallery view,
                and the newest release button displays the last ten Amiibos released.
                Game series, Amiibo Series, and Amiibo Type are drop downs that filter out the search results.

                We started off with a simple website design that contains a search bar for the user and buttons to
                filter out results.
                The buttons didn’t have functionality yet except for the search button.
                A small detail that we decided to include was to have the search function activate on either the button
                or the ‘Enter’ keyboard button.
                If there’s more than one result from a search, it’ll display all the results in a flex box display.
                The color scheme we decided on was red and white since those were colors that represented Nintendo as a
                company.
                After implementing the search functionality, we decided to code the random button as well as the filters
                that soon came after.
                Overall, we believe that we should receive an A for this project considering all the features that we
                have added.
                A cool Amiibo that we found that we suggest searching would be "mario cereal".

                Camilo coded the majority of the framework and the basic javascript functions that hold our website's
                functionality.
                Camilo created the github and layed out the foundation as well as picked out the source images.
                Michael coded some of the features that Camilo laid out for him such as the random button and helped
                with the drop down filters.
                Michael also made the documentation page and helped with displaying the API's information.
                We both worked on the design of the website such as the colors and layout.
