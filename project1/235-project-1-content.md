### Story

In the mysterious lands of the Grand Grassland food has become quite scarce.
Different races of animals have found their way of life disturbed and need to
create new societies in order to survive the harsh environment. One of the most
successful societies to come out of this situation is the nomadic tribe of Hamster
Warriors. Led by the incredible intuition of a wise sage who understands the 
alchemic properties of the elements, this tribe of hamsters have found success in
dividing its numbers into three different groups.
Food gatherers, who do exactly as their name suggests and find food at every stop
in their journey. Assistant alchemists, who collect various natural materials such
as dirt, leaves, sticks, etc... to aid the grand sage; that he may spend more time
thinking about how to invent new creations or optimizing old ones. Lastly there are
the Bouncers, the tribe's scouts and powerful defense line. They are called that way
because they have been equipped by the sage with special hamster balls made of rubber
that store elastic energy built up by bouncing around between surfaces. The Bouncers
train each other in the art of using this incredible weapon to defeat foes much larger
in size. Snakes, eagles, foxes, many have fallen short to the expertise of the Bouncers
before. The biggest hero of the tribe, warrior Rico Chet, is the most dextrous and
courageous fighter of them all. This game is the legend of how Rico escorted his tribe
across the Grand Grassland and into greener pastures.

### Esthetics

The game will have a cartoony art style. The story is an epic tale sprinkled with the
fantasy that comes with a tribe of nomad hamsters fighting epic wars against predators
ten times their size.
The music will be epic but fast paced to match the action displayed on screen.
UI will be minimal and most information displayed to the player, such as momentum
charge will be expressed through color change and intensity, as well as through the
sound.
The game will have a lot of screen shake and sounds to sell the action of hamsters
in rubber balls bouncing around between rocks and trees to land one gigantic hit
on their enemy.
